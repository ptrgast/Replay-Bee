# Replay-Bee
This is a small game I created for Arduino Day 2017. The concept of the game is to hear some notes and then try to repeat them in the same order you heard them. The core of the game runs on an Arduino with a photo-resistor and buzzer connected to it and the controller runs on a browser. The photo-resistor acts as a control input and the browser acts as a light pulse emitter so there is no need for radio modules.

## Prerequisites

To compile and burn the Arduino code you must have the  [Strobbio](http://ptrgast.com/strobbio/) receiver v1.0.0 installed in your libraries.
